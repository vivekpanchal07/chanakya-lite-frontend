# Password Manager

This project aims to create a secure and user-friendly password manager application.

## Features

* **Secure Password Storage:**  Uses strong encryption to protect passwords from unauthorized access.
* **Auto-Generation:**  Generates strong, random passwords for new accounts.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  Accessible on multiple devices (desktop, mobile) for convenience.
* **Cloud Synchronization:**  Keeps passwords synchronized across devices.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Adds an extra layer of security.
* **Password Auditing:**  Identifies weak passwords and suggests improvements.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Intuitive design for easy navigation and password management.

## Technologies

The project will be built using the following technologies:

* **Frontend:**
    * [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/) (or another suitable framework)
    * [HTML, CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
    * [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* **Backend:**
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) (or another server-side language)
    * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (or another web framework)
    * [Database]:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Security

Security is paramount in a password manager application. We will implement the following measures:

* **Strong Encryption:**  Using industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect stored passwords.
* **Password Hashing:**  Salting and hashing passwords to prevent them from being stored in plain text.
* **Secure Authentication:**  Implementing secure login mechanisms, such as 2FA.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conducting periodic security reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
* A database (if using a backend)
